												<h3>Youtubers</h3>
											</header>
											<p>These are quite possibly some of the biggest motivators I have utalized on my own low-impact journey. It makes a world of difference to get advice from real people, and I hope they can help you like they've helped me.</p>
											<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Gittemary"> Gittemary Johansen</a><p> Gittemary Johansen is a zero-waste, vegan youtuber based out of Denmark (the majority of videos are in English). She is one of my absolute favorites and has tons of videos on how to live a low-waste lifestyle. She also talks about her mistakes, even years into this way of living, which is extremely impactful for beginners.</p>
												<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkq2gEWE-i647M71bh7zDxA">Sustainable Vegan</a><p> Sustainable Vegan, as she is known on social media, makes videos about-you guessed it- Veganism and Sustainability. She is based out of London, and has a ton of videos about zero-waste, low-impact, and no-spend challenges. She is great to watch. Check her out!</p>
											<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3cJEWlDyZfeyOLSDjR7fw"> The Fairly Local Vegan</a><p> Check out this youtuber, based in Canada, for advice on how to live a vegan and minimalist lifestyle. She has plenty of tips on how to transform your life to be more present and have less 'stuff'. She also is one of the only people I've come across who can give advice from the perspective of a mother. She also dabbles with some low-waste tendencies. She's awesome, check her out.</p>
												<li><a> href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4sORY6tWJMcaplqvuMMdLQ"> The Girl Gone Green</a><p>Check out Manuela, known as the Girl Gone Green. She is a great example of a minimalist, vegan, and zero-waste student. Go check her out if you want some advice. </p>

												<h3>Food Specific Videos</h3>
											</header>
											<p>One of the hardest parts about changing your lifestyle can be diverging from your usual eating habits. I grew up in a home where meat was the focal point of every meal; even being someone who never particularly liked meat, my mom called me her "self-proclaimed vegetarian" because I would eat the bare amount of meat allowed, old habits are hard to break. These are some of the sites that helped me learn new dishes BOTH vegan and vegetarian. Also, remember that this does not have to be an overnight change, drop meat a few days a week and slowly increase if you need to. Keep in mind that many of the youtubers I've listed also do recipe videos.I hope these help!</p>
											<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEjkioV3LO_OIUaSWRxFZ3A"> Cheap Lazy Vegan</a><p> Check out Cheap Lazy Vegan's channel to find a TON of recipes that are easy and inexpensive to make. All of these are vegan and the ones that I've tried have all been delicious. Look her for some new ideas about what to cook when transitioning to veganism.</p>
												<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cxMY7jZ_kiE2bvykJffZA"> Caitlin Shoemaker</a><p> Caitlin Shoemaker makes a ton of recipe videos, all vegan. The best part about how she makes her videos are you can generally choose whether you want ideas for a whole day of food or you can look at a group of recipes for specific meals or food types ie Mexican or Italian.</p>
												<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/tastyvegetarian/"> Tasty Vegetarian</a><p> Tasty Vegetarian is a branch of Buzzfeed's Tasty division. It offers a ton of very easy recipes that are specifically vegetarian. These can help if you want to eat a specifically vegeatarian diet. This is a great step for a lifestyle change or as a transitioning point before going vegan. They also have a page on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGazVV4FXec&list=PL8zglt-LDl-hbTt_pVnyaqj-05nYR89hB"> youtube.</a></p>
												<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFP3z7f8mc&list=PL8zglt-LDl-jWBz8wUaQU8NQqNuwZhIt1"> Tasty Vegan</a><p>Tasty from Buzzfeed also has a lot of vegan options within their Tasty Vegetarian division. These can be found on intermixed their vegetarian facebook page, but they have a separate playlist on their youtube channel to make searching easier.
